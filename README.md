# AnnulusTracker
I know I know, not another tracking app, but this one will have a core feature that I've never been able to find in any other to-do list/tracking app, the ability to mark something as not done or missed.

Most tasks that I find myself putting on a to-do list are either time sensitive or have some other requirement that means if I don't complete them within a certain window, they just can't be completed. And I've loved tracking apps that allow you to see what you've completed each day in the past, especially for repeated tasks. But I've never found one that has any other option than "complete" for a task, and despite me recommending it to some of them, I've yet to see it added.
It feels gross to mark something as complete that you didn't do just to get it off of the to-do list, and for repeating tasks like showering or cleaning areas of the house, it's nice to know when and why I might have missed it. So I plan to build the app around that idea, that you're going to miss tasks, that sometimes they just won't be done, and the ability to log that it wasn't done and why you didn't do it can be a valuable tool in learning how you can complete the task in the future.
